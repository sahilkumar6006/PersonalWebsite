        <h4>10 Things tou should know about Albert Einstein</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <P>he never failed math. this is a popuular "fact" promoted on the internet, msybe in an attempt to
                    relate to geniu.however, it is simply not true.overall, einstein was an average student,but math was
                    on one area where he excelled, unsuspringly </P>
            </li>
            <li>
                <P>Over the next 30 years, Harvey sent a few slides to other researchers who requested them, but kept
                    the rest of the brain in two glass jars, sometimes in a cider box under a beer cooler. The story of
                    Einstein's brain was largely forgotten until 1985, when Harvey and his colleagues published their
                    study results in the journal,</P>
            </li>
            <li>
                <P>Photoelectric effect: Einstein's work in 1905 proposed that light should be thought of as a stream of
                    particles (photons) instead of just a single wave, as was commonly thought at the time. His work
                    helped decipher curious results scientists were previously unable to explain. </P>
            </li>
            <li>
                <P>Unified field theory: Einstein spent much of his later years trying to merge the fields of
                    electromagnetism and gravity. He was unsuccessful, but may have been ahead of his time. Other
                    physicists are still working on this problem.</P>
            </li>
            <li>
                <P>Albert Einstein was born in Germany on 14 March 1879.</P>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Einstein’s parents were both Jewish and he had a younger sister called Maja.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Although he apparently didn’t like school, Einstein showed he had a great mind for maths and science
                    from a young age.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When he was just five years old, his father bought him a compass. His enquiring mind immediately
                    started trying to work out just why the needle always pointed north!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <P>Einstein began to make his mark after he took a job at the Patent Office in Bern, where he looked
                    into other people’s inventions. While he was there he worked on his own discoveries and found out
                    many things that became of great importance in the world of physics.</P>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Einstein is probably most famous for his ‘theory of relativity’ and the equation he made famous,
                    e=mc², which proved that even the smallest amount of mass (basically the stuff that’s in
                    everything!) can be turned into a huge amount of energy.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <p>Einstein lived in Germany during World War 1 but he was a pacifist – this meant he didn’t believe in war
                and violence and wanted disagreements to be settled peacefully. In 1933 he moved to the USA.</p>
